help.editProductsImages2 = This tool allows you to upload product images to the server from the local file system.<br /><br />It has been designed to load images with names specifically-designed to be used with the default storefront application of KonaKart.  The number of images that can be associated with a product is unlimited and can be configured (the default is 8).  You can upload any number of images although at least 1 image is recommended.<br /><br />The filename chosen for the uploaded image files is generated by the system (many aspects of the names can be configured using File-Based Configuration (Enterprise Edition only)).<br /><br />Both the generated image filename directory and the generated product UUID are shown at the bottom of the panel for diagnostic purposes only (they cannot be modified directly but can be used to identify the images created after they have been uploaded).<br /><br />Supported image formats: JPG, JPEG, GIF and PNG.
help.editProductsQuantities = This screen is used to manage the stock information of a product. The information presented on the panel is different depending on whether the product has been assigned attributes. For example if you have a shirt that comes in various colors and sizes
help.editProductsSpecial = This panel allows you to set price information for a product. <b>Price1 to Price3</b> are optional price fields that can be used for saving other prices such as wholesale price or MRP. User groups may be configured to use one of these alternative prices
