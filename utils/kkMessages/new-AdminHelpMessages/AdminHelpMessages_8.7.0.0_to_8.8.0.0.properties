The configuration variable to configure this behaviour, may be found in the <b>Configuration >> Security and Auditing</b> section of the admin app. If the default state for reviews (through this configuration variable) is set to 1 (Invisible state), then they will not be displayed on the storefront until the state is changed using this panel.<br /><br /><b>File based configuration</b> can be used to define the number of reviews shown in each group returned from the database.<br /><br />Click the <b>Settings</b> icon to set the following:<br /><ul><li>Reviews per page</li></ul>
