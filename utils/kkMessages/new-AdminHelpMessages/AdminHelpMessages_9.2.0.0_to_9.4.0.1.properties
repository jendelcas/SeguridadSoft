help.orderReturnStatus = These are the order return statuses that are defined for your online store. <br /><br />You can define as many order return statuses as you please. Order return statuses describe the status of order returns in the system.<br /><br />An order return status has a name and an id.  You should define the name in each language that you want to provide in the store.<br /><br />During an insert you may define the value of the numeric order return status id or let the system assign the next available id by leaving the input field empty. You can only update the names not the Id.  It is not recommended that you change the order return status Ids.  Normally the order return status Ids would be defined early on in the system design and remain the same with new ones added.<br /><br />An order return status is selected by clicking on it, and then it may be edited or deleted.<br /><br />A new order return status may be created by clicking the <b>New</b> button, defining the new order return status in the edit fields at the bottom, then clicking on the <b>Save</b> button to insert the new entry into the database.
