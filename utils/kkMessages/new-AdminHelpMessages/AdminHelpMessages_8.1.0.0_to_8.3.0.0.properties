help.editCustomerHierarchy = This panel allows you create hierarchical customer structures which can be used in a B2B environment to determine customer privileges. From this panel you can select a group of customers and set them as children of the current customer.<br /><br />In order to associate customers to the current customer, you must follow these steps:<ul><li>Search for the customers either by email, company or both and click the <b>Search</b> button. The default implementation for the search is to add wildcards before and after the search strings so you may for example, easily search for an email domain to retrieve all customers with that domain.</li><li>Add one or more customers by selecting them on the left panel and then by clicking the <b>>></b> button to add them to the right panel. If the customer information is partly truncated and not all readable, place your mouse over the information to see the complete string in the floatover text.</li><li>Any unwanted customers may be removed from the right panel by selecting them and clicking the <b>Del</b> button.</li><li>When you are happy with the selection, you must click the <b>Save</b> button to write the changes to the database. </li></ul>From the <b>konakartadmin_gwt.properties</b> file you may configure certain aspects of the panel:<ul><li>Whether and where wildcards are inserted for the customer search strings. The default is to have wildcards before and after the search strings.</li><li>The maximum number of customers returned by a search.</li><li>The template for displaying customer information. The default is to show the first name, last name, company and email. These are the available attributes although you may decide not to display them all or to change the order etc.</li></ul>
