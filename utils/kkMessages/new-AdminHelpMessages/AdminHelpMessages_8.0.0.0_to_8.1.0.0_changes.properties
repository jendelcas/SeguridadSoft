help.configFiles = These are the configuration files that are defined for your online store. <br /><br />To edit a file, first select it, then click the "<b>Edit</b>" button to edit it. <br /><br />To upload a file, (if you are authorised to do so), first select the file in the list you want to replace with your local file, then click the "<b>Upload</b>" button to upload it (a local file system browser dialog will appear allowing you to select the local file, and then finally to upload it). Note carefully that you should exercise extreme caution when replacing these citical KonaKart configuration files.<br /><br />To reload the list of files click the "<b>Reload</b>" button.  This re-reads the list of files to display from the file that defines this list (the <b>konakart_config_files.xml</b> file).<br /><br />Note that most of the parameters in these configuration files will not actually take effect until you restart KonaKart.<br /><br />If you wish to change the list of files that are shown in the list you have to edit the <b>konakart_config_files.xml</b> file which you will find under <b>webapps/konakartadmin/WEB-INF/classes</b>.  In the default installation on Windows that is:<b>C:\Program Files\KonaKart\webapps\konakartadmin\WEB-INF\classes\konakart_config_files.xml</b><br /><br />Do not tick the checkbox on the right of each configuration parameter if you do not want it to be returned by the storefront APIs.  If you do not need a configuration variable to be returned by the storefront APIs uncheck the field to improve performance and security.<br /><br /><b>Please Note:</b> By default the <b>Edit</b> and <b>Upload</b> functions will not be enabled as a security precaution.  These can be enabled in the konakartadmin.properties file.
help.orderStatus = These are the order statuses that are defined for your online store. <br /><br />You can define as many order status names as you please. Order statuses describe the status of orders in the system.<br /><br />An order status has a name and an id.  You should define the name in each language that you want to provide in the store.<br /><br />During an insert you may define the value of the numeric order status id or let the system assign the next available id by leaving the input field empty. You can only update the names not the Id.  It is not recommended that you change the order status Ids.  Normally the order status Ids would be defined early on in the system design and remain the same with new ones added.<br /><br />There is also a check box to define the default behavior when the status of the order is changed in the admin app using the edit order panel. This panel contains a check box for notifying the customer (by eMail) of a status change
