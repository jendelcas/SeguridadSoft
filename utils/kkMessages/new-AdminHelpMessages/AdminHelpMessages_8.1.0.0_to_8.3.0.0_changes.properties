help.editCustomerPoints    = This panel allows you to manage the reward points of a customer. Whenever points are added to or removed from a customer's account, a transaction record is created which may have an optional <b>code</b> and <b>description</b>. The code is intended to categorize the type of transaction such as  ORDER, REG or REV if the points are generated due to an order or because a customer has registered or because he has written a review etc. The description is intended to provide a more verbose explanation which the customer can view in the store front application after logging in.<br/><br/>Using this panel, the administrator may assign and deduct points from a customer's account by clicking either the <b>Add Points</b> or <b>Remove Points</b> button. In both cases, a new transaction record is created which may have its own code and description. After adding or removing points, the panel is refreshed and the new total is visible as well as the new transaction record. The <b>Ex</b> column of the transaction record displays whether the points of the record have expired (red circle) or are valid (green circle).
help.editCustomerTags      = This folder is used to view, edit, insert and remove customer tag values for a customer. The tags are used for marketing purposes, to show dynamic content, to determine whether to activate a promotion and to filter the recipients of customer mailings. Expressions can be created using the tags, that can be evaluated in real time to display dynamic content. i.e. Show a banner or activate a promotion only to customers over 50 years old that have viewed products in a particular category. Tags may also be used in a B2B scenario to hold information about a customer such as whether the customer has an order limit or whether the customer can view orders of other customers that have been defined in the customer hierarchy tree. <br/><br/>Normally, for the marketing tags, the value of a tag is set automatically as a customer uses the store front application. For example, a tag may be set to store the search string as a customer searches for a product, or to store the current basket total, or to store the id of a product or category that the customer is viewing. This folder allows you to view the current tag values for a customer and to modify them.<br/><br/>All of the defined customer tags are listed in the list box on the left hand side. The tags that have a value for this customer are listed in the panel on the right hand side. In order to add one or more tags, they must be selected and then added by clicking the <b>>></b> button. A value has to be entered for the tag before saving. If the <b>Validation</b> attribute of the selected tag, contains regular expression, then the value is validated against this regular expression. Internally the tag value is always stored as a string, although each tag has a type and utility methods for getting and setting the value as a date, integer, decimal, boolean and integer array. Therefore do not be alarmed if instead of seeing a date, you see a long number or see a string that looks like :23:1:78: when the tag is of type MULTI_INT. For the case of a date, the float-over text will always tell you what the date actually is.
help.editProductsAttributes = Attributes may be added to the product by selecting the options from the list box (multiple selections are allowed) and then clicking the arrowed button to create the attribute details on the right hand side of the window. The default number of options displayed, as well as the number of results displayed after a search, may be customized in the <b>Configuration>>AdminApp Configuration</b> section of the Admin App.<br /><br />For each attribute you must enter a numeric value which will be added or subtracted from the price of the product if the customer selects this option. You may enter optional values <b>P1 to P3</b> which will be used if the customer is using product <b>Price1 to Price3</b>. For example if your store supports both retail and wholesale customers which are differentiated by the customer group that they belong to, you will probably be displaying different prices to them. In this case, if a product has options, the option prices can also be differentiated.<br /><br />The attributes <b>C1 and C2</b> are custom values that may be set with custom data.<br /><br />The arrows above and below the <b>DEL</b> (delete) button allow you to modify the ordering of the attributes. The order set here is reflected in the storefront application.<br /><br />The <b>IMG</b> button opens a popup panel where you can add images for the attribute (e.g. specific images for a blue shirt). The image names are created from the option code and the option value code and so these must be set before adding any images.
help.editProductsDetails_1 = When the product is <b>disabled</b>, it is not returned by the API calls and so does not appear on your storefront.<br /><br />The product may be assigned one or more <b>custom attribute templates</b> which allow you to define an unlimited number of custom attributes for the product. After assigning a template, the custom attributes within the template appear under the Custom Tab in a sub tab called Template Attributes. The templates are only saved after clicking the save button in the edit product panel.<br /><br />The <b>product types</b> visible in the drop list may be modified by adding a comma separated list of integers representing the types to exclude. Look at the on-line help of the <b>Configuration >> Admin App Configuration</b> section of the Admin App for more details on this. If you are running the Enterprise Version of KonaKart you can exclude and order the product types using file based configuration by editing the <b>konakartadmin_gwt.properties</b> file.<br /><br /><b>Invisible products</b> are by default not returned by the KonaKart server API and therefore not shown in the shopping application (your store). This default functionality can be overridden by setting <b>showInvisible</b> in the <b>DataDescriptor</b> object used in the API calls. The Invisible products are still available for ordering via the API, so can be useful in certain circumstances. You can configure the Admin App to either show the invisible products in the Admin App (the default) or not show them (see the Configuration section). In the Solr configuration section you can configure whether invisible products are added to the suggested search list and to the suggested spelling list.<br /><br />When a product type of <b>Bundled Product</b> is selected, some extra buttons appear on the UI:<ul><li><b>Select Products</b> opens up a pop-up window to enable the selection of products to include in the bundle. When this pop-up window is closed, the selected products are not saved in the database until the save button on this window is clicked. </li>

When this pop-up window is closed, the selected products are not saved in the database until the save button on this window is clicked. </li><li><b>Calc Weight</b> sets the Weight field of the bundle product by adding the weights of the products in the bundle. The calculated weight can be overridden at any time and is not saved in the database until the Save button is clicked.</li></ul>The <b>Product Id</b> can be made invisible / visible by setting the configuration variable under <b>Configuration >> Admin App Configuration</b>.
help.editProductsDescription = A product name and description must be entered for each language. The product URL, the Product Comparison Data and various Custom Fields (if displayed) are not compulsory.<br /><br />The <b>Product Comparison Data</b> is structured data that can be used on the UI to compare this product with a similar product. For example, it could be XML where each tag represents a feature of the product. <br /><br />The <b>Custom Fields</b> can be used for any purpose and the labels can be changed to reflect what the fields should contain.  The custom field lengths can be modified in the database if required (by default they are set to be very short fields to optimise performance when these are not required).  Their display on this panel can be enabled using File-Based Configuration and their validation defined using Custom Validation.<br /><br /><b>Note:</b> The Insert or Save button will not be enabled until valid data has been entered in all compulsory fields (outlined in red) in <b>all tabs</b>. If you are wondering why the Insert or Save button isn't enabled, you should cycle through all of the tabs outlined in red and look for entry fields outlined in red.
help.editProductsMerchandising = Products may be associated with other products so that when selected, the application displays the associated products to attempt to convince the customer to buy an accessory or a more expensive but similar product or an extended warranty etc. KonaKart supports the following types of merchandising:<ul><li><b>Up-selling</b> is a sales technique whereby a salesman attempts to have the consumer purchase more expensive items, upgrades, or other add-ons in an attempt to make a more profitable sale. Up-selling usually involves marketing more profitable services or products, but up-selling can also be simply exposing the customer to other options he or she may not have considered previously.</li><li><b>Cross-selling</b> is the strategy of selling other products to a customer who has already purchased (or signalled their intention to purchase) a product from the vendor. For example, you could show more books from the same author.</li><li><b>Accessories</b> for a product can be displayed in order to persuade the customer to purchase them while purchasing the main product. For example you could show a range of notebook cases when a customer is buying a notebook PC.</li><li><b>Dependent Products</b> are products which need to be sold together with the main product. They normally consist of service plans or extended warranties.</li><li><b>Custom Relationships</b> may be created to associate a product with other products in order to meet specific business requirements.</li></ul><br />In order to associate some products to the main product, you must follow these steps:<ul><li>Select the merchandising type from the drop list</li><li>Search for the products by typing a search string and clicking the <b>Search</b> button</li><li>Add one or more products by selecting them on the left panel and then by clicking the <b>>></b> button to add them to the right panel</li><li>Any unwanted products may be removed from the right panel by selecting them and clicking the <b>Del</b> button</li><li>When you are happy with the selection, you must click the <b>Save</b> button to write the changes to the database. Note that the <b>Save</b> button must be clicked before moving onto another merchandising type.</li></ul>
help.editProductsQuantities = This screen is used to manage the stock information of a product. The information presented on the panel is different depending on whether the product has been assigned attributes. For example if you have a shirt that comes in various colors and sizes, you will probably want to know how many you have in stock for the various color / size combinations. If the product has no attributes, then the only fields visible are the ones that allow you to input stock data for a single SKU. Otherwise you are presented with an array that allows you to enter stock data for multiple SKUs.<br /><br />When inserting a product the multiple SKU array will never be present until the product has been saved since it can only display data based on product attributes that already exist. You must save the product, click the <b>Back</b> button and then edit the product in order to insert SKU / quantity / date available data.<br /><br />If the Warn of Duplicate SKUs configuration variable is set to true in the <b>Configuration >> Admin App Configuration</b> section of the Admin App, then a warning appears when the system detects that the SKU entered already exists.<br /><br />The <b>Quantity</b> field for a bundle product is read-only. It is calculated by considering the quantities of all components of the bundle and the lowest quantity is returned. If the quantity of a product within the bundle is greater than 1 then this information is also used within the formula.<br /><br />The <b>Stock Reorder Level</b> defaults to -1 which means that the global value defined by the STOCK_REORDER_LEVEL configuration variable is used. If set to a positive number, then this value will override the global value.<br /><br /><b>Can order when not in stock</b> defaults to the global value defined by the STOCK_ALLOW_CHECKOUT configuration variable. The default value can be overridden on a product by product basis, by setting it to yes or no.<br /><br /><b>Ignore Qty for Variations</b> is used by KonaKart when the product has been assigned attributes and you may assign an SKU and quantity for each variation (e.g. small, medium, large). When checked, the individual quantities are not used and the stock level is taken from the single quantity attribute assigned to the product.
help.editProductsSpecial   = This panel allows you to set price information for a product. <b>Price1 to Price3</b> are optional price fields that can be used for saving other prices such as wholesale price or MRP. User groups may be configured to use one of these alternative prices, so that you can differentiate the prices that you users see based on the group that they belong to. If one or more Payment Schedule objects exist in the database, then a drop list will be displayed where you can choose a recurring billing payment schedule for this product.<br /><br />If a special price is entered, then this price will become the new special price of the product. The check box is used to enable the special price. When disabled it will not be visible within the store front application. The duration of the special offer may be programmed by setting a start date and an expiry date. In both cases the date may be picked from the calendar widget and the precision may be set by choosing the exact hour and minute from the drop lists. For performance reasons, the start and end dates are not used on each product select query. Instead they are used by the AdminProductBatchMgr (Enterprise Version Only) to enable / disable the special based on these dates. Note that special price functionality is not supported when using catalog prices.<br /><br />Tier prices may be defined for the product in order to modify the price based on the volume ordered. Each tier price contains the standard four price fields as well as a custom field that may contain any text useful for the store front application. i.e. A message catalog key. The <b>Use Percentage Discount</b> checkbox determines whether the prices entered are actual prices or percentage discounts. i.e. If the price field contains 10.00 and the checkbox is checked, this means that a 10% discount will be applied to the standard price rather than a price of $10.00.<br /><br />In the case of a bundle a <b>Calc Price</b> button appears that sets the price fields of the bundle product by adding the prices of the products in the bundle. A discount can be entered into the calculation by typing a number in the Discount field next to the Calc Price button. The discount number will be treated as a percentage if the % character is entered after the number. (e.g 10% rather than 10). The calculated prices can be overridden at any time and are not saved in the database until the Save button is clicked.
help.filters               = <b>Filters</b><br /><br />These are the filter records that are defined for your online store. Filters are used to restrict access to certain records on a per user basis.  For example, filters can be used to allow a user to see only certain orders and another user to see another set of orders.  This feature can be used to implement order processing workflow using the Admin Console.<br /><br />Each filter record has a userId, a table, a column, a constraint and some custom fields.  The custom fields are for your own custom purposes.  By default the custom fields are hidden but you can enable these using File Based Configuration (see the konakartadmin_gwt.properties file in the konakartadmin webapp for details).<br /><br />The filter constraints will be executed by the database so they need to be legal SQL constraints such as "= 4" or "in (1,2,3)".<br /><br />Create a new filter by clicking on <b>New</b> then fill out the required data for the filter, then finally click on <b>Save</b>.<br /><br />Click the <b>Settings</b> icon to set the following:<br /><ul><li>Filters per page</li></ul>
help.insertStore           = This panel allows you to insert a new store.<br /><br />You specify the storeId here but you cannot change this after your save the store the first time.  The storeId you choose must be unique - the system will not let you insert a new store with a storeId that's already being used.<br /><br />The name and description can be changed at any time.<br /><br />The store status settings are defined as follows:<br /><br /><b>Enabled</b> = active stores that are available for use.  If disabled a store is not accessible to application or admin app users. <br /><br /><b>Under Maintenance</b> = stores that are currently being maintained so are inaccessible to application users, but can be accessed by admin app users.<br /><br /><b>Deleted</b> = stores that are deleted are no longer available for use by application or admin app users.  These stores are not physically deleted from the database but only marked as "deleted".  Therefore it is possible to "Un-delete" a store if required.
help.ipnHistory            = This window allows you to view and search for notifications sent to KonaKart by payment gateways. Many payment gateways can be configured to send transaction information to KonaKart regarding the status of the payment, and this information is stored in a database for auditing purposes.<br /><br />The <b>KonaKart Result</b> will be positive if the transaction completes successfully regardless of the payment gateway response. The <b>Gateway Result</b> is the actual result from the gateway and will vary depending on the payment gateway you are using. The <b>Gateway Full Response</b> contains the full set of data returned by the gateway. The <b>Transaction Type</b> defines the type of transaction and the <b>Transaction Amount</b> the value of the transaction. The <b>Capture Id</b> may be populated in the case where the transaction was an Auth and needs to be followed by a Capture. In this case the Capture Id is the string that needs to be passed to the Capture transaction in order to identify the transaction. In a similar fashion the <b>Credit Id</b> is the Id that is normally returned by a Capture and can be used in the future for any credit / refund transactions. The <b>Admin Payment Class</b> is the full class name of the class that contains the code for carrying out future transactions such as Capture or Credit transactions.<br /><br />An order may be associated with many payment notifications for various reasons. For example, a customer may make more than one attempt at entering his credit card details or an order may be split up into multiple payments or there may be an auth, followed by a capture followed by a credit transaction.<br /><br />Click the <b>Settings</b> icon to set the following:<br /><ul><li>Callback Records per page</li></ul>
help.miscItems             = These are the <b>Miscellaneous Items</b> that are defined for your online store. <b>Miscellaneous Items</b> can be added to products and / or categories for a variety of different uses within the system.<br /><br />A <b>Miscellaneous Item</b> has a value, a miscellaneous item type, an object type (eg product or category) and the id of the object it is associated to.<br /><br />You can <b>search</b> for miscellaneous items by using the search panel at the top of the display.  Enter all or part of the miscellaneous item name and all the records that contain this text will be returned.  (For every match that is found, all the language variants of that matching miscellaneous item are also returned, even if they do not also match the search text).<br /><br />The <b>Save</b> button is enabled when all the fields are populated correctly (and the record is validated successfully).<br /><br />Clicking the <b>Cancel</b> button will discard any changes you have made since the last save and the original values will be restored to the screen.<br /><br />Click on the <b>New</b> button to create a new miscellaneous item. Note that the button will not be enabled until you have inserted at least one miscellaneous item type.<br /><br />Click the <b>Settings</b> icon to set the following:<br /><ul><li>Miscellaneous Items per page</li></ul>
help.orderStatus           = These are the order statuses that are defined for your online store. <br /><br />You can define as many order status names as you please. Order statuses describe the status of orders in the system.<br /><br />An order status has a name and an id.  You should define the name in each language that you want to provide in the store.<br /><br />During an insert you may define the value of the numeric order status id or let the system assign the next available id by leaving the input field empty. You can only update the names not the Id.  It is not recommended that you change the order status Ids.  Normally the order status Ids would be defined early on in the system design and remain the same with new ones added.<br /><br />There is also a check box to define the default behavior when the status of the order is changed in the admin app using the edit order panel. This panel contains a check box for notifying the customer (by eMail) of a status change, and the value of this check box is set automatically by the value of the order status attribute. This functionality is useful for helping administrators adhere to a process that defines at which states changes eMails should be sent to customers. Note that within the edit order panel, the default may be overidden.<br /><br />An order status is selected by clicking on it, and then it may be edited or deleted.<br /><br />A new order status may be created by clicking the <b>New</b> button, defining the new order status in the edit fields at the bottom, then clicking on the <b>Save</b> button to insert the new entry into the database.
help.prodAttrs             = Custom attributes are attributes which you may define and then add to a template which in turn may be added to a product. This panel allows you to create new and manage existing attributes. Each custom attribute definition has the following attributes:<ul><li><b>Name:</b> The name of the custom attribute which is a compulsory field. i.e. ScreenSize or MegaPixels etc.</li><li><b>Type:</b> You may choose types from a drop list. This information may be used by the storefront application when displaying the attribute value. i.e. If it knows the type of attribute it may decide what template to use in order to display it.</li><li><b>Facet:</b> If the custom attribute is used for faceted search, it must be mapped to one of the SOLR facet fields.</li><li><b>Set Function:</b> This is used by the admin app when creating a UI widget for the custom attribute. Valid Set Functions are:<ul><li>integer(min,max) where min and max may be numbers or set to null. i.e. integer(10,null) checks that the integer has a minimum value of 10 or above. Integer(null,null) just checks that the value entered is an integer without doing any range checking.</li><li>double(min,max) using the same logic as explained above for decimal numbers.</li><li>string(min,max) using the same logic as explained above for the length of the string.</li><li>choice('true','false')creates a radio button panel with the options of true and false. choice('msg.small','msg.medium','msg.large') creates 3 radio buttons where the labels are looked up in a message catalog. In this case, the text displayed is looked up from the message catalog, whereas the values saved are always msg.small, msg.medium and msg.large regardless of the language.</li><li>option(0=date.day.long.Sunday,1=date.day.long.Monday,2=date.day.long.Tuesday) creates a drop list for the first 3 days of the week. The text of the days displayed is retrieved from the message catalog whereas the saved data is 0 for Sunday, 1 for Monday etc. </li><li>RichText(x) where x defines the vertical size (in elements) of the Rich Text data entry widget. (e.g. RichText(10) for a size of 10em)</li></ul></li><li><b>Template:</b> The template contains a string that may be used by the storefront application to display the value. i.e. In the case of a date, the storefront application could detect that it is a date from the <b>type</b> and then use the template to display the date correctly. </li><li><b>Msg Cat Key:</b> This is used by the storefront and admin applications to look up the label from the message catalog. If not present, the <b>name</b> may be used.</li><li><b>Validation:</b> This may contain regular expression such as true|false or [0-9]* which will be used by the admin app to validate the attribute.</li><li><b>Custom Fields:</b> The custom fields may contain any metadata for the attribute which can be used by the storefront application. i.e. A custom field may contain data useful for grouping custom attributes.</li></ul>When custom attributes are converted to an XML string and saved within the product object, some metadata fields of the custom attribute are saved along with the value of the attribute itself. These metadata fields (i.e. Message catalog key, the template for displaying the attribute and the custom fields) are stored in the XML for performance reasons. When a Product Attribute Descriptor is modified or deleted, all of the products using the descriptor are not updated automatically. A dialog box appears where you can choose whether to update the products. If the “Yes” button is clicked, then the code loops through all products using the Product Attribute Descriptor and updates the XML. If there are many products, this process may take a while.<br /><br />Click the <b>Settings</b> icon to set the following:<br /><ul><li>Custom Attributes per page</li></ul>
help.productOptions        = A list of product options is shown on the left side of the window. The available values for each option can be viewed by clicking the <b>+</b> symbol next to the option name. Each option or option value may be edited or deleted, by selecting it and clicking the appropriate button. The default number of options displayed, as well as the number of results displayed after a search, may be customized in the <b>Configuration>>AdminApp Configuration</b> section of the Admin App.<br /><br />An option may be of four different types.<ul><li>The <b>Standard</b> type is where each option value defines a product attribute which may or may not modify the price of the product (i.e. “Small”
help.productAvailableDate  = This panel is intended for a power user to quickly update the available date of a product based on its SKU.<br/><br/> The intended way of using the panel is to enter the SKU and then to tab into the Date field. At this point the SKU will be looked up and if it is valid, the product name will appear below the SKU field and the current available date will appear below the Date field. If the SKU is invalid, then the color of the SKU field will remain outlined in red. Once a valid date has been entered, the Save button will activate and so you can tab to it and press the enter key to save the data. At this point, the focus will be returned to the SKU field and a line will be written to the log area to confirm that the transaction was successful.<br/><br/>The check box below the log area allows you to decide whether you want the date field to be cleared after the save button is clicked. If you have multiple SKUs with the same date, it is convenient not to clear the field. The date template allows you to change the date template for entering the date. For example you may want to enter just two numbers for the year rather than four.<br/><br/>The log area may be cleared by clicking the clear button below the log.
help.productQuantity       = This panel is intended for a power user to quickly update the quantity of a product based on its SKU.<br/><br/> The intended way of using the panel is to enter the SKU and then to tab into the Quantity field. At this point the SKU will be looked up and if it is valid, the product name will appear below the SKU field and the current quantity will appear below the Quantity field. If the SKU is invalid, then the color of the SKU field will remain outlined in red. Once a valid quantity has been entered, the Save button will activate and so you can tab to it and press the enter key to save the data. At this point, the focus will be returned to the SKU field and a line will be written to the log area to confirm that the transaction was successful.<br/><br/>The check box below the log area allows you to decide whether you want the new quantity to be added to the existing quantity or whether you want it to replace the existing quantity.<br/><br/>The log area may be cleared by clicking the clear button below the log.
help.products              = You may search for products using a combination of various filters:<br /><ul><li>Products containing some text</li><li>Products by SKU</li><li>Products within a category</li><li>Products of a manufacturer</li><li>Products of a certain type</li><li>Products coming soon</li><li>Products on special offer</li></ul>Wildcard configuration parameters control the precise searches of substrings (See <b>Configuration >> Admin App Configuration</b>) but with the default settings a wildcard is added before and after all search text which means that all <b>Apples</b> will be returned if you enter <b>ple</b> as the search string.<br /><br />To search by ID you must check the ID check box and enter the numeric product ID in the text field above the search button. To search by SKU, you must check the SKU check box and enter the SKU in the text field above the search button. If no check box is checked, the search is done on the product name. The description is included if the Search Desc. box is checked. By default the search is not case sensitive if you are using MySQL or MS-SQLServer and case sensitive if you are using PostgreSQL, Oracle or DB2. You can configure your database to be non-case sensitive (refer to the User Guide for details on how to modify the case-sensitivity).  Once the search criteria have been set, you must click the search button.<br /><br />Any displayed product may be edited or deleted by clicking the respective buttons at the bottom of the list. Click the <b>New</b> button to create a product.<br /><br />If you've defined one or more product catalogs, a <b>Remove From Cat</b> button will be visible. The functionality associated with this button is to remove all catalog prices and quantities defined for the selected product and selected catalog.<br /><br />The product id and sku (if set) can be viewed by moving the mouse over the product name in the array of products.<br /><br />Using <b>File based configuration</b> you can configure the panel to display the product SKU instead of the product name. In this case the mouse float-over displays the product id and the product name.  File based configuration can also be used to define the number of products shown in each group returned from the database and to set case-insensitive searching for case-sensitive databases.<br /><br />Click the <b>Settings</b> icon to set the following:<br /><ul><li>Products per page</li></ul>
help.promotions            = A promotion is an offer that a merchant may apply to any number of his products. Promotions may be searched for, created, edited and deleted. To search for a promotion, either enter the id or the name and click the <b>Search</b> button. The results of the search are displayed in an array. The id of any promotion may be viewed as floatover text by placing your mouse over the name of the promotion in the array. Once a promotion has been created, clicking the <b>Rules</b> button allows you to refine it by adding rules for Manufacturers
help.refunds               = This panel allows you manage refunds. You can insert, edit and delete refund information and also perform real time refunds through a payment gateway.<br><br>When the <b>New</b> button is clicked, the fields for the new refund object are automatically populated with the Order Id, the Order Number, the total amount of the order and the Transaction Identifier which is retrieved from the payment information that was saved during the original transaction. Before saving, this information may be modified. For example, you may wish to change the amount refunded if it is only a partial refund. When you click the <b>Save</b> button, the refund information is saved in the database and a pop-up dialog appears asking you whether you wish to perform a real time refund through the payment gateway. If you answer <b>Yes</b> the refund transaction is executed and the result is returned in the <b>Refund Status</b> field. A value of "0" (equivalent to an amber bullet in the list view) means that a transaction hasn't taken place. A value of "1" (green bullet) means that the transaction was successful and a value of "-1" (red bullet) means that the transaction wasn't successful. If you click the <b>Payment Info</b> button, a panel opens that shows you the information exchanged with the payment gateway in order to understand for example, why a transaction may have failed. Note that it is only possible to carry out a real time refund transaction if the payment gateway (during the original payment transaction) saves the transaction id and populates the Admin Payment Class attribute with the class name of the class that the Admin App can use to perform the refund.<br><br>If the <b>Send eMail</b> check box is checked, an eMail is sent to the customer based on a Velocity template for the state of the order. The template is different depending on whether the order is placed in the <b>Refund Approved</b> or <b>Refund Declined</b> state. The default value of the check box may be set by the fbc.kk_panel_refunds.send_mail parameter in konakartadmin_gwt.properties.
help.shipments             = An order may have multiple shipments (i.e. The products within the order may be shipped at different times). A shipment is associated with an order referenced by the order id. It may also contain an order number, a tracking number and shipping notes. If one or more shippers have been defined under <b>Localizations >> Shippers</b>, then they will appear in the drop list so that a shipper can be selected for the shipment. If a tracking URL has been defined for the shipper, then the tracking URL field will be automatically populated when a shipper is selected from the drop list. If the tracking URL contains the <b>{TRACK_NUM}</b> placeholder, it will be substituted with the actual tracking number either when the shipment is saved or when the shipper is selected (if the tracking number has already been entered). Each shipment contains a number of shipped products whose quantity cannot exceed the total number of products within the order.<br /><br /><b>Searching and Editing</b><br />Shipments may be searched for by the id of the order, the order number or by the tracking number. You must enter the search constraints and then click the <b>Search</b> button. This will retrieve all shipment objects matching the search criteria. In most cases there will only be one shipment per order. When you click on a row containing a shipment, the details of the shipment are displayed. Below these details, you will see a list of products that the order contains. Each product can be identified by its product Id and / or its SKU. You may modify the number of products shipped by entering a number that cannot be greater than the quantity within the original order. Clicking the <b>Save</b> button saves the modification.<br /><br /><b>Inserting</b><br />To insert a new shipment, you must click the <b>New</b> button and enter an Order Id. All other fields are optional. When you tab out of the Order Id field after having entered the id of an existing order, a list of products appears, all with shipped quantity set to 0. You may change these quantity fields to match the actual products that have been shipped and then click the <b>Save</b> button to save the shipment. If your orders have an Order Number, you may enter that instead of the Order Id, and when tabbing out of the Order Number field the product list appears in the same way as just described. When this window is opened from the Orders window after having selected an order, the Order Id and Order Number fields are automatically populated with data from the selected order.<br /><br />Click the <b>Settings</b> icon to set the following:<br /><ul><li>Shipments per page</li></ul>
