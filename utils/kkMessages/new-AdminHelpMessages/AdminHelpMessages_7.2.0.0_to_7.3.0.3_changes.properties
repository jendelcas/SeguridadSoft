help.cacheConfig        = <b>Caching</b><br /><br />KonaKart is configured using the configuration variables present within this section of the Administration Application. The variables are stored within the <b>configuration</b> database table and may be edited from this panel.<br /><br />Changes may take a few seconds to become active because the application cache needs to be reloaded, and this happens on a scheduled basis at the frequency defined by the <b>Client config cache refresh check interval</b> configuration variable that can be edited on this panel.<br /><br />Do not tick the checkbox on the right of each configuration parameter if you do not want it to be returned by the storefront APIs.  If you do not need a configuration variable to be returned by the storefront APIs uncheck the field to improve performance and security.<br /><br />In the Enterprise version of KonaKart you can choose to <b>enable or disable the caching</b> of Products and/or Product Image names.<br /><br />You can set a maximum size for the KonaKart Product Cache (maximum number of products) - ensure you allocate enough memory to java.<br /><br />Cache Management (flushing etc) is controlled by KonaKart Events - you can choose whether or not to create some of these events.  If you choose to create an event (eg Quantity Change Events) this will cause the relevant product to be removed from the cache so that its Quantity is updated next time it is read.<br /><br />See the User Guide for more details on how to configure caching in KonaKart.<br /><br />Most variables have float over text with a short description of their functionality.
help.editCustomerPersonalEdit = Enter the personal details for the Customer.<br /><br />You cannot change the password here. Instead use the "Reset Password" on the Customers panel.<br /><br />The <b>Customer Type</b> may take one of three values:<ol><li>An Administrator User</li><li>A Standard Application Customer</li><li>A Default Customer. There should only be one of these. It is a fictitious customer used to create a temporary order for displaying order totals before the checkout process. i.e. In the edit cart screen a customer can see estimated shipping costs and promotional discounts without having to log in or register. The address of the default customer should be an address that will generate average shipping costs. i.e. If the majority of your business is national then it shouldn't be an international address.</li></ol><br/>If the <b>Customer Group</b> is changed to a valid new group, you will be prompted to send a template based eMail to the customer. This is a useful feature for when the customer is going through an approval process. For example, a customer may have registered through the application as a wholesale customer. During registration he was placed in a "Waiting for Approval" customer group and now the administrator may approve or decline the request. As a result of the approval, the customer may receive an eMail informing him of the decision. The template used is in the form <b>CustGroupChange_groupId_lang.vm</b> e.g. CustGroupChange_2_en.vm, if the customer has been moved to the group with id equals 2 in a system where the lang is "en".<br /><br />The <b>External Reference</b> attributes are placeholders for identifiers that identify the customer in external systems such as a payment gateway that stores credit card details or a national identification number.
help.editCustomerPersonalInsert = Enter the personal details for the Customer.<br /><br />The password field will display dots instead of the characters that you type.<br /><br />The <b>Customer Type</b> may take one of three values:<ol><li>An Administrator User</li><li>A Standard Application Customer</li><li>A Default Customer.

help.editProductsSpecial = This panel allows you to set a special price for a product as well as setting tier prices for the product.<br /><br />If a special price is entered, then this price will become the new special price of the product. The check box is used to enable the special price. When disabled it will not be visible within the store front application. The duration of the special offer may be programmed by setting a start date and an expiry date. In both cases the date may be picked from the calendar widget and the precision may be set by choosing the exact hour and minute from the drop lists. For performance reasons, the start and end dates are not used on each product select query. Instead they are used by the AdminProductBatchMgr (Enterprise Version Only) to enable / disable the special based on these dates. Note that special price functionality is not supported when using catalog prices.<br /><br />Tier prices may be defined for the product in order to modify the price based on the volume ordered. Each tier price contains the standard four price fields as well as a custom field that may contain any text useful for the store front application. i.e. A message catalog key. The <b>Use Percentage Discount</b> checkbox determines whether the prices entered are actual prices or percentage discounts. i.e. If the price field contains 10.00 and the checkbox is checked, this means that a 10% discount will be applied to the standard price rather than a price of $10.00.
help.manufacturers      = A number of manufacturers within the database are shown in the list box in alphabetical order. The default number of manufacturers displayed, as well as the number of results displayed after a search, may be customized in the <b>Configuration>>AdminApp Configuration</b> section of the Admin App.<br /><br />Each manufacturer may be edited or deleted. If you choose to delete a manufacturer that has products linked to it in the database, you will be presented with the option of allowing the system to delete the products also.<br /><br />An <b>image</b> for the manufacturer may be uploaded by selecting a file from the file system and then clicking the upload button. By default the file will be uploaded to the manufacturer directory (default is "manufacturer" but can be overridden in File Based Configuration) which is appended to the Image Base Path (defined by a configuration variable that can be managed in the Configuration>>Images section of this application). Before clicking the upload button, the file name (for the file that will be created) may be changed and extra path information may be added.<br /><br />A new manufacturer may be created by clicking the <b>New</b> button.<br /><br />The <b>Products</b> button opens a window displaying a list of products for the chosen manufacturer.<br /><br />The <b>Manufacturer Id</b> can be made invisible / visible by setting the configuration variable under <b>Configuration >> Admin App Configuration</b>.
help.returns            = An order may have multiple returns (i.e. The products within the order may be returned at different times). The return must contain a Return Merchandise Authorization code (RMA) and may contain text explaining the reason for the return. Each return contains a number of returned products whose quantity cannot exceed the total number of products within the order.<br /><br /><b>Searching and Editing</b><br />Returns may be searched for by the id of the order, the Order Number or by the RMA. You must enter the search constraints and then click the <b>Search</b> button. This will retrieve all return objects matching the search criteria. In most cases there will only be one return per order. When you click on a row containing a return, the details of the return will be displayed. The details include the Order Id, Order Number, the RMA Code and the Return Reason. Below these details, you will see a list of products that the order contained. Each product can be identified by its product Id and / or its SKU. You may modify the number of products returned by entering a number that cannot be greater than the quantity within the original order. Clicking the <b>Save</b> button will save the modification.<br /><br /><b>Inserting</b><br />To insert a new return, you must click the <b>New</b> button and enter an Order Id and an RMA Code. The Order Number is optional. When you tab out of the Order Id field after having entered the id of an existing order, a list of products will appear, all with return quantity set to 0. You may change these quantity fields to match the actual products that have been returned and then click the <b>Save</b> button to save the return. If your orders have an Order Number, you may enter that instead of the Order Id, and when tabbing out of the Order Number field the product list appears in the same way as just described. When this window is opened from the Orders window after having selected an order, the Order Id and Order Number fields are automatically populated with data from the selected order.<br /><br />The <b>AdminOrderIntegrationMgr</b> contains a <b>getRMACode()</b> method which automatically generates an RMA code based on the order id that is used to populate the entry field. This method may be modified to add your own custom algorithm. In order to force manual entry of the RMA Code
help.subZones           = A tax area or geographical zone is an area which may span multiple physical areas such as countries or states. In KonaKart it is used for defining tax areas which share a tax rate and for geographical areas used when setting up shipping and payment modules to define where these modules may be used. e.g. A certain shipping module may only be used for domestic and not international shipping.<br /><br />This panel is used to map tax areas / geo zones to certain physical zones within countries or all physical zones of a country.  Once defined
