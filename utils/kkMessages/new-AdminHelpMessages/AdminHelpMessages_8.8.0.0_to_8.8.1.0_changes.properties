help.customers = You may search for a customer by entering the last name in the Search Panel and then clicking the Search button. By default the search is not case sensitive if you are using MySQL or MS-SQLServer and case sensitive if you are using PostgreSQL, Oracle or DB2. You can configure your database to be non-case sensitive (refer to the User Guide for details on how to modify the case-sensitivity).  Wildcard configuration parameters control the precise searches of substrings (See <b>Configuration >> Admin App Configuration</b>) but with the default settings a wildcard is added before and after all search text which means that all <b>Smiths</b> will be returned if you enter <b>mith</b> as the Last Name. In a similar fashion you can search for a customer based on certain fields of his address (street, city and postcode). <br /><br />You may also search for all customers belonging to a customer group, for administrator users and for users that have been enabled or disabled. An administrator can define default values for the customer group and customer type droplists (see <b>Configuration >> Admin App Configuration</b>), and also whether these droplists are visible for a certain user using role-based security.  In KonaKart, an administrator can also log into the application with the same credentials and so can be considered to be a user and a customer.<br /><br />The Address field may be customized through a template, and even disabled completely. The template can be found under <b>Configuration >> Admin App Configuration</b> and valid template fields are:<ul><li>$cr - Carriage return (new line)</li><li>$firstname</li><li>$lastname</li><li>$company</li><li>$streets = $street + line break + $suburb</li><li>$street</li><li>$suburb</li><li>$city</li><li>$postcode</li><li>$state</li><li>$telephone</li><li>$telephone1</li><li>$email</li><li>$country</li></ul>To disable the address field you must leave the template empty.<br /><br />Any displayed customers may be edited or deleted by clicking the respective buttons at the bottom of the list.<br /><br />Click the <b>Orders</b> button to view any orders that the customer may have submitted.<br /><br />Click the <b>Email</b> button to send an email to the customer.<br /><br />Click the <b>Login</b> button to log in to the KonaKart eCommerce application as the selected customer, in a new browser window. The base url and the features of the new window can be configured under <b>Configuration >> Admin App Configuration</b>. The user must have edit privileges for the Customers panel in order for this button to be visible.<br /><br />Click the <b>Reset Password</b> button to reset a customer's password - an email will be sent to the customer containing the new password.<br /><br />Click the <b>Subscriptions</b> button to go to a panel showing any recurring billing subscriptions that may be associated with the selected customer. If your store doesn't support recurring billing, then this button may be removed in the <b>Configuration >> Admin App Configuration</b> section of the Admin App.<br /><br />When in multi-store single database, non-shared customer mode (and the logged in administrator is a super user) you will see a <b>Clone</b> and a <b>Del Multi Store</b> button which are used to manage users across multiple stores. After clicking one of these buttons, you can choose the destination stores for cloning or deleting. The clone operation clones the currently selected customer in the destination stores and the multi store delete, deletes any customer with a matching eMail address from the destination stores. These buttons may be hidden by configuring the role privileges of the Customers2 panel.<br /><br /><b>File based configuration</b> can be used to define the number of customers shown in each group returned from the database and to set case-insensitive searching for case-sensitive databases.<br /><br />Click the <b>Settings</b> icon to set the following:<br /><ul><li>Customers per page</li></ul>
