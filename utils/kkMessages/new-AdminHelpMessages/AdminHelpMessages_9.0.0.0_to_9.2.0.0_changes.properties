help.orders       = This panel can be configured to display the Order Id or the Order Number in the left most column. The Order Id is generated by KonaKart automatically and is a unique ascending integer. The Order Number may be generated by custom business logic just before an order is saved and so may adhere to company standards etc. The Order Number may contain both letters and numbers. The panel can be configured in the <b>Configuration >> Admin App Configuration</b> section of the Admin App.<br /><br />You may search for orders using a combination of various filters:<br /><ul><li>Orders from a customer using the customer's id</li><li>Orders based on their Order Id or Order Number</li><li>Orders in a certain state</li><li>Orders from a customer using the customer's name</li><li>Orders from a customer using the customer's email address</li><li>Orders from a customer using the customer's postcode</li></ul>Once the search criteria have been set, you must click the search button.<br /><br />Any displayed orders may be edited or deleted by clicking the respective buttons at the bottom of the list.<br /><br />Click the <b>Invoice</b> button to view, print and send the invoice. The template used for the displayed (and PDF) invoice is called OrderInvoice. The template used for the email that sends the invoice is OrderInvoiceAttachment. In konakartadmin_gwt.properties you can set fbc.kk_display_panel.invoice.send_attachment to false so that the invoice is not sent as a PDF attachment. Default behaviour is to send it as an attachment of the email.<br /><br />Click the <b>Packing Slip</b> button to view and print the packing slip.<br /><br />Click the <b>Payment Info</b> button to view any payment gateway information that may be associated with the order.<br /><br />Click the <b>Returns</b> button to view / edit / insert any information regarding products that have been returned.<br /><br />Click the <b>Refunds</b> button to view / edit / insert any information regarding refunds and to perform real time refunds through the payment gateway. This button may be hidden by setting the fbc.kk_panel_orders.hide_refunds parameter in konakartadmin_gwt.properties.<br /><br />Click the <b>Export Order</b> button to export the order as an XML file (Business or Enterprise Editions Only). The root directory for file creation is set by the configuration variable in the <b>Configuration >> Shipping / Packing</b> section of the Admin App.<br /><br />Click the <b>Export Order For Shipping</b> button to export the order for shipping. This option uses code in the Shipping Modules to export the order in a format appropriate for a 3rd Party Shipping Application - such as for UPS WorldShip. The root directory for file creation is set by the configuration variable in the <b>Configuration >> Shipping / Packing</b> section of the Admin App.<br /><br />Click the <b>Customer</b> button to go to a panel showing information about the customer that submitted the order. From this panel you can send an eMail to the customer, log in to the application as the customer etc.<br /><br />Click the <b>Subscriptions</b> button to go to a panel showing any recurring billing subscriptions that may be associated with the selected order. If your store doesn't support recurring billing, then this button may be removed in the <b>Configuration >> Admin App Configuration</b> section of the Admin App.<br /><br /><b>File based configuration</b> can be used to define the number of orders shown in each group returned from the database.<br /><br />Click the <b>Settings</b> icon to set the following:<br /><ul><li>Orders per page</li><li>Hide Custom Search Fields</li></ul>
help.resetDatabase = <b>Reset Database</b><br /><br /><b>PROCEED WITH CAUTION</b><br /><br />On clicking the <b>Delete</b> button the database will be emptied of all of the following records:<br /><ul><li>Products</li><li>Categories</li><li>Product Options</li><li>Bookings</li><li>Miscellaneous Items</li><li>Subscriptions</li><li>WishLists</li><li>Expressions</li><li>Custom Attributes and Custom Attribute Templates</li><li>Promotions</li><li>Audit Data</li></ul><br />This is a way to empty the database when you want to remove all the sample data that is provided in the default KonaKart installation.<br /><br />Note that Customers and Orders are not removed and neither are the reference records such as Currencies, Languages and Tax-related objects.<br /><br />Following a successful execution of this command the database will be ready to add your own data without any sample data remaining.<br /><br />Clearly this is a powerful operation so <b>should only be used if you are certain you want to empty your database</b>.  Note that there is no undo operation to get the deleted data back.
help.jobs         = <b>KonaKart Job Scheduler</b><br /><br />This panel allows you to monitor and execute batch jobs defined for your system.<br /><br />To execute a job, select the required job in the table then click on the <b>Run</b> button.  If successful, this will refresh the list of jobs in the table and show the job that you selected in a new row as an "Executing" job.<br /><br />You can view the log file for a job by selecting the row of the job that is <b>Executing</b> and clicking the <b>View</b> button.<br /><br />If you do not see any jobs listed it may be because Quartz is not enabled in your web.xml file for the konakartadmin webapp.<br /><br />After clicking the <b>Run</b> or <b>Refresh</b> buttons a series of automatic refreshes will commence with the number of outstanding automatic refreshes being displayed on the <b>Refresh</b> button.  The automatic refresh parameters are configurable in the konakartadmin_gwt.properties file.
