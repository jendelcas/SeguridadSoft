help.importer           = <b>KonaKart Importer</b><br /><br />This panel allows you to import data from files into KonaKart using custom import routines.  Please refer to the User Guide for more details.<br /><br />For the <b>Import</b> and <b>Delete</b> commands you first need to select one or more files or directories to operate on before clicking on the respective buttons.<br /><br />By default, the <b>Import</b> button is configured to load products into KonaKart from the selected file.  An example datafile (productsExample.xml) is provided which is an example of the format of the file that is required for this simplified import routine. <br /><br />You can upload new data files for subsequent import by clicking on the <b>Upload</b> button.<br /><br />The <b>Refresh</b> button updates the set of files in the directory specified to hold the data files.   You can configure the location of the data files directory on the panel at <b>Configuration >> Importer Configuration</b>.  Likewise you can configure where the importer log files will be written on the same configuration panel.<br /><br />${help.DefaultApiSecurity}
help.userToRoles        = This window allows you to add and remove roles from an Admin User.<br /><br />Admin Users are displayed in the list on the left hand side of the window. You can select from the drop list whether to view store administrators or B2B customer administrators. When you select a user, the user's roles are displayed in the <b>Assigned Roles</b> list and the available roles are displayed in the <b>Available Roles</b> list. You can add roles by selecting them in the <b>Available Roles</b> list and then clicking the <b>Add</b> button. You can remove roles by selecting them in the <b>Assigned Roles</b> list and then clicking the <b>Remove</b> button. Note that multiple selects are allowed. You must click the <b>Save</b> button in order to save any modifications.
help.addressFormats     = These are the address formats that are defined for your online store. Valid template key words are:<ul><li>$cr - Carriage return (new line)</li><li>$firstname</li><li>$lastname</li><li>$company</li><li>$streets = $street + line break + $suburb</li><li>$street</li><li>$street1</li><li>$suburb</li><li>$city</li><li>$postcode</li><li>$state</li><li>$telephone</li><li>$telephone1</li><li>$email</li><li>$country</li><li>$custom1</li><li>$custom2</li><li>$custom3</li><li>$custom4</li><li>$custom5</li></ul><br />An address format describes the way addresses will appear in different parts of the system. You define all the address formats you want to use here and then specify which ones you want to use in specific parts of the system elsewhere (eg. each country has an address format defined). The formatting is performed by substituting the above keywords with the actual values within the address object.<br /><br />An address format has a full format and a summary format - you should define both for each address format you create.<br /><br />An address format is selected by clicking on it, and then it may be edited or deleted.<br /><br />A new address format may be created by clicking the <b>New</b> button, defining the new address format in the edit fields at the bottom, then clicking on the <b>Save</b> button to insert the new entry into the database.
help.stores             = <b>Store Maintenance</b><br /><br />If you have been granted sufficient privileges, you may search for a store in the mall by entering any combination of the search criteria at the top of the panel then clicking the Search button.<br /><br />The search is not case sensitive unless your database is configured to be non-case sensitive.  Wildcard configuration parameters control the precise searches of substrings (See <b>Configuration >> Admin App Configuration</b>) but with the default settings a wildcard is added before and after all search text which means that, for example, storeId <b>StoreX</b> will be returned if you enter <b>tor</b> as the StoreId.<br /><br />In a similar fashion you can search for a store in the mall on whether or not it is enabled or disabled, under maintenance or not under maintenance and whether or not it is marked as deleted.<br /><br />Only the stores you are authorized to maintain will be returned.<br /><br />Any displayed stores may be edited or deleted by clicking the respective buttons at the bottom of the list assuming the relevant privileges have been granted to the current user.<br /><br />The user must have edit store privileges for the Edit Store panel in order for the Edit button to be visible.<br /><br />To create a new store click the <b>New</b> button whereupon a new panel will be displayed on which you define the attributes for the new store.<br /><br />To create a new store by cloning an existing one select the store to clone then click the <b>Clone</b> button whereupon a new panel will be displayed on which you define some attributes to execute the clone and define the new storeId.  Stores created by cloning are initialised to be "Under Maintenance".<br /><br />To delete a store select the store to delete then click the <b>Delete</b> button whereupon a confirmation dialogue will be displayed.  Click on the <b>Yes</b> button to confirm.  Note that the store isn't actually deleted from the database by a delete operation, it is merely marked as deleted.  Thus, it is possible to undelete a store that has been deleted by editing the deleted store and unchecking the <b>Deleted</b> box.<br /><br /><b>Enabled</b> = active stores that are available for use.  If disabled a store is not accessible to application or admin app users. <br /><br /><b>Under Maintenance</b> = stores that are currently being maintained so are inaccessible to application users, but can be accessed by admin app users.<br /><br /><b>Deleted</b> = stores that are deleted are no longer available for use by application or admin app users.  These stores are not physically deleted from the database but only marked as "deleted".  Therefore it is possible to "Un-delete" a store if required.<br /><br />The <b>Vendor</b> button takes you to a new panel where you can view the vendor associated with the selected store. To associate a new vendor to a store, click the <b>Vendor</b> button. If the vendor already exists you must search for the vendor using the search fields at the top of the panel. Otherwise you need to insert a new vendor. Once the vendor has been selected, you must click the <b>Add Vendor To Store</b> button which returns you to this panel.
help.importerConfig     = <b>Importer Configuration</b><br /><br />Configuration settings for Importer Jobs<br /><br />As with other Configuration Settings, you can modify these values and refresh the caches (see under the <b>Tools</b> menu) to see them have an instant effect (although some that affect the Admin App require you to log out then log in again).<br /><br />There are 3 Custom Import buttons that can be configured to execute import operations (see the Importer Panel).  If these require configuration settings then this panel would be a good place to put them.
help.editCustomerPersonalInsert = Enter the personal details for the Customer.<br /><br />The password field will display dots instead of the characters that you type.<br /><br />The <b>Customer Type</b> may take one of four values:<ol><li>A Store Administrator that can use the Admin App</li><li>A Standard Storefront Customer</li><li>A B2B Customer Administrator. This customer type can administer users for his own company using the storefront application.</li><li>A Default Customer. There should only be one of these. It is a fictitious customer used to create a temporary order for displaying order totals before the checkout process. i.e. In the edit cart screen a customer can see estimated shipping costs and promotional discounts without having to log in or register. The address of the default customer should be an address that will generate average shipping costs. i.e. If the majority of your business is national then it shouldn't be an international address.</li></ol>The <b>External Reference</b> attributes are placeholders for identifiers that identify the customer in external systems such as a payment gateway that stores credit card details or a national identification number.<br /><br />When editing or inserting a customer a check is always made to ensure that the eMail address is unique. In konakartadmin_gwt.properties you can set the following file based configuration variables: <ul><li>fbc.kk_panel_insertCustomer.username_unique = true</li><li>fbc.kk_panel_insertCustomer.telephone_unique = true</li><li>fbc.kk_panel_insertCustomer.telephone_1_unique  = true</li></ul>to enforce uniqueness checking on the customer's username and the telephone numbers.
help.editProductsImages2 = This tool allows you to upload product images to the server from the local file system.<br /><br />It has been designed to load images with names specifically-designed to be used with the default storefront application of KonaKart.  The number of images that can be associated with a product is unlimited and can be configured (the default is 8).  You can upload any number of images although at least 1 image is recommended.<br /><br />The filename chosen for the uploaded image files is generated by the system (many aspects of the names can be configured using File-Based Configuration (Enterprise Edition only)).<br /><br />Both the generated image filename directory and the generated product UUID are shown at the bottom of the panel for diagnostic purposes only (they cannot be modified directly but can be used to identify the images created after they have been uploaded).<br /><br />Supported image formats: JPG, JPEG, GIF and PNG.<br /><br />Click the <b>Move Up</b> button to move the image one place higher up in the display order.
help.address.prod       = This panel enables you to manage addresses for products.<br/><br/>Each product may be associated with multiple addresses. Each address may be associated to multiple products, which is useful for instance when the address is used to define a drop shipper who may be responsible for more than one product.<br/><br/>The <b>Select Addr</b> button allows you to select an address from a list in a dialog box. The default number of addresses displayed before and after a search may be customized in the <b>Configuration>>AdminApp Configuration</b> section of the Admin App. This section of the admin app also allows you to define how the address is formatted in the select dialog box as well as in the main panel. Note that an address may be searched for using the company name since products will normally be associated to companies such as drop shippers. When the <b>Select </b> button is clicked in the dialog box after selecting one or more addresses, you are returned to the address panel and will see the new addresses in the list.<br/><br/>The <b>Remove</b> button allows you to remove an address from a product without actually deleting it. The removed address may be re-associated with the product by selecting it from a list as explained above. The <b>Delete</b> button actually deletes the address rather than just removing the link between the address and the product. If the address is being used by other products, you are warned of this in a confirmation pop-up and can decide to cancel the delete request.<br/><br/>If the address is edited and the <b>Save</b> button is clicked, the changes will apply for all products using this address. The Default Addr check box may be used to signal the importance of one or more addresses. Unlike for customer addresses, KonaKart does not enforce uniqueness and it is not mandatory for any of the addresses to be the default.<br/><br/>The <b>New</b> button allows you insert a new address which will automatically be associated with this product and be made available for other products in the selection dialog box.
help.editCustomerPersonalEdit = Enter the personal details for the Customer.<br /><br />You cannot change the password here. Instead use the "Reset Password" on the Customers panel.<br /><br />The <b>Customer Type</b> may take one of four values:<ol><li>A Store Administrator that can use the Admin App</li><li>A Standard Storefront Customer</li><li>A B2B Customer Administrator. This customer type can administer users for his own company using the storefront application.</li><li>A Default Customer. There should only be one of these. It is a fictitious customer used to create a temporary order for displaying order totals before the checkout process. i.e. In the edit cart screen a customer can see estimated shipping costs and promotional discounts without having to log in or register. The address of the default customer should be an address that will generate average shipping costs. i.e. If the majority of your business is national then it shouldn't be an international address.</li></ol><br/>If the <b>Customer Group</b> is changed to a valid new group, you will be prompted to send a template based eMail to the customer. This is a useful feature for when the customer is going through an approval process. For example, a customer may have registered through the application as a wholesale customer. During registration he was placed in a "Waiting for Approval" customer group and now the administrator may approve or decline the request. As a result of the approval, the customer may receive an eMail informing him of the decision. The template used is in the form <b>CustGroupChange_groupId_lang.vm</b> e.g. CustGroupChange_2_en.vm, if the customer has been moved to the group with id equals 2 in a system where the lang is "en".<br /><br />The <b>External Reference</b> attributes are placeholders for identifiers that identify the customer in external systems such as a payment gateway that stores credit card details or a national identification number.<br /><br />When editing or inserting a customer a check is always made to ensure that the eMail address is unique. In konakartadmin_gwt.properties you can set the following file based configuration variables: <ul><li>fbc.kk_panel_insertCustomer.username_unique = true</li><li>fbc.kk_panel_insertCustomer.telephone_unique = true</li><li>fbc.kk_panel_insertCustomer.telephone_1_unique  = true</li></ul>to enforce uniqueness checking on the customer's username and the telephone numbers.
help.logging            = <b>Logging</b><br /><br />Logging is typically only used for diagnostic purposes and recommended to be set off <b>OFF</b> for normal use. <br /><br />To see diagnostic logging from the KonaKart Admin App you need to set the <b>Admin App logging level</b> to a level higher than <b>OFF</b> (for example set it to "INFO") and ensure that the <b>log4j.logger.com.konakart.clientlogging</b> value in <b>konakartadmin/WEB-INF/classes/konakart-logging.xml</b> is set to the same level (or higher) (for example set it to "INFO" or "DEBUG").  <br /><br />You can edit that <b>konakart-logging.xml</b> file from the <b>Edit Config Files</b> configuration menu option.<br /><br />The KonaKart log file directory is the location where certain KonaKart diagnostic log files are written eg. payment gateway response log files, velocity results files etc.  This is also for diagnostics only and no log files are written unless other debug flags are set elsewhere. <br /><br />${help.returnByApi}<br /><br /><b>Analytics</b><br /><br />Enabling Analytics causes some code (that is defined in the Messages.properties file, as key <b>analytics.code</b>) to be inserted into your store's web pages.  The intended use for this feature is to insert analytics code (for example Google Analytics Code) into your store so that you can obtain useful statistics on the use of your site.
